# Netflix Clone Landing Page

**Project:** Build a Netflix Landing Page using vanilla javascript, HMTL and CSS.

**Plan:** Utilize CSS Grid and flexbox to recreate the landing page of Netflix.

- images may be copied from source
- free fontawesome icons maybe used instead
- need to be resposive website
- make it as close as the real Netflix landing page
- upload to github

**Challenge:** add functionality when icon tabs are clicked, showing features and different tiers for signing up to Netflix.

**Approach:** I utilized webpack and Sass to practice using these tools despite the size of the project. Solidify my knowledge on these tools. Avoid any video tutorials.
